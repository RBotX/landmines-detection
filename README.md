# Landmines Detection project

Repository containing some of the data and the scripts used to generate datasets and run the classification tasks on some methods. Each dataset directory will contain a brief explanation about the methods used to classify the samples.

The preprocessed data and some datasets cannot be find in this repository as they are quite large in size (some GBs). So they are hosted on other platform accessed only by the team members.
